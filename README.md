# Telegram Chatbot with GPT Integration

This project is a Telegram chatbot that integrates OpenAI's GPT models, allowing users to interact with the bot and ask questions. The bot responds using the GPT model and provides relevant answers to the user's queries. Additionally, a basic Flask web server is included to demonstrate the project running as a background service.

## Features

- Telegram bot interface using the aiogram library.
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT API to provide intelligent responses.
- Basic Flask server running in a background thread.
- Easy-to-deploy project with environment variable support.

## Prerequisites

1. *Python*: Make sure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your system.
2. *Telegram Bot Token*: Create a new bot on Telegram via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) and get the token.
3. *OpenAI API Key*: Sign up on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and get your API key.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-chatbot-gpt.git
cd telegram-chatbot-gpt


### Step 2: Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


### Step 3: Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


### Step 4: Set up environment variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:


OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token


Alternatively, you can export these variables in your shell:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-telegram-bot-token


### Step 5: Run the chatbot

You can now run the bot using the following command:

python bot.py


This will start the bot and Flask server in the background.
